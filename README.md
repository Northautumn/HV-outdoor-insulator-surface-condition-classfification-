# HV-outdoor-insulator-surface-condition-classfification-
The CNN model with Hyperband Optimization using Keras tuner and Keras sequential model. The dataset was augmented using skimage and Open CV libraries.
The dataset consists of images of two classes "wet" and "dry" insulators. "Wet" class represents the high-voltage outdoor insulators of transmission lines which have the water on its surface. On the contrary, the "dry" class is the HV insulator with dry surface.
